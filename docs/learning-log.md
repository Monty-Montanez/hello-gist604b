# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Monty Montanez
**Date:** 10/26/2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create new GIThub files, that empty folders cant be created, and how to create new repositories
- Issues point out what needs to be worked on and also tracks progress on its completion
- Documentation matters so people know how they can use your work, so it can be reproduced if necessary, and gives necessary information

## Challenges and Solutions
The assignment itself wasnt difficult but I am having a tough time figuring out the automated grading.

## Connection to My GIS Career
Learning GitHub gives me real control over my work. It keeps projects organized, trackable, and easy to collaborate on. Version control is a huge deal in GIS since so many workflows involve scripts, plugins, and shared data. Being comfortable with GitHub makes me more effective on technical teams and better prepared for roles that blend GIS with development or automation.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
